# Boredom 
Boredom can be both destructive and beneficial, depending on how it's handled. When left unchecked, it can lead to unproductive habits or restlessness, but I've learned to use boredom as a tool rather than a setback. I try to channel it into something positive by staying engaged with extracurricular activities, learning opportunities, or personal projects that keep me motivated and growing. At the same time, I’ve come to appreciate that moments of stillness and calm don’t have to feel like a waste—they can be a chance to reset, reflect, and enjoy peace without pressure. Finding that balance helps me make the most of both action and rest.
