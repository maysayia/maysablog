# About me ⋆ ˚｡⋆୨♡୧⋆ ˚｡⋆

I'm an IT student at Imam Mohammed bin Saud University who loves diving into the fast-paced, ever-changing world of technology. I enjoy learning something new every day, and while the field can be challenging, I find it exciting, spontaneous, and fun. I'm always looking for ways to grow and improve, fueled by a genuine passion for IT and problem-solving.
